# Models

This Python module contains the models used or tested for this project. The following list describes where the code originally comes from:

* `action_spotter.py` and `netvlad.py` - [Silvio Giancola's SoccerNetv2-DevKit](https://github.com/SilvioGiancola/SoccerNetv2-DevKit)
* Certain parts of `graph_action_spotter.py` were adapted from [Anthony Cioppas's CALF Calibration Model](https://github.com/SilvioGiancola/SoccerNetv2-DevKit/tree/main/Task1-ActionSpotting/CALF_Calibration_GCN)
* `vggish.py` - [Harri Taylor's PyTorch implementation of VGGish](https://github.com/harritaylor/torchvggish)
